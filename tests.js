Test this secret codes:

['b', 'o', 'r', 'g']

['r', 'r', 'r', 'p'] // this involves a fascinating optimization that I haven't yet coded!

Also, you should program to randomly select among unused colors. 
- As in, don't always go in the same order ('r', 'b', 'g', 'y', 'o', 'p')
- Randomizing may give you better overall results
- Wait until you write scalable tests to try this out though
