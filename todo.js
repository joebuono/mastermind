/*

Make a clean folder/file structure
- Folders containing files containing individual (or grouped) functions

You should program the algorithm to randomly select among unused colors. 
- As in, don't always go in the same order ('r', 'b', 'g', 'y', 'o', 'p')
- Randomizing may give you better overall results
- Wait until you write scalable tests to try this out though

Program the clever optimization for ['r', 'r', 'r', 'b'] 
- Your second move is ['r', 'r', 'r', 'r']
- Your third move is ['g', 'g', 'g', 'y'] ***
*** Very clever! Code this up. 


Game mode!
- Can you beat the algorithm one-on-one?!
- That'd be fun!

Learning mode
- Visually see what the algorithm is doing

Code breaker
- Normal game mode

Code maker
- Can you make a code that stumps the algorithm?!
