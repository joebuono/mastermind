Comparison between Buono and Knuth implementations of Mastermind solver algorithm:

4-code
Buono's algo: Average of average cases: 4.886
- By the way, it took 17.125 seconds to play 129,600 entire games (100 games for each possible permutation)
Single worst average: 5.480
Average for worst cases: 6.906
Single worst worst case: 8 (not great)


Knuth
Single worst average case for code size 4: 5
Global average for average cases for code size 4: 4.476
Knuth algo: 16:32.580 (m:ss.mmm)

It took over 16.5 minutes to play 1,296 games with Knuth's algorithm (1 game for each possible permutation)

Let's confirm that the worst worst case is indeed 5:
- I really wonder what his AVERAGE worst case is, and how much it differs from mine

Single worst worst case for code size 4: 5
Global average for worst cases for code size 4: 4.475

Exactly how many orders of magnitude more efficient is my algorithm, in terms of time complexity?

------------------

For 5-codes, Knuth's algorithm is too slow for me to compare it with mine. 

Here are my metrics for code size 5:

Single worst average case for code size 5: 8
Global average for average cases for code size 5: 6.545

Single worst worst case for code size 5: 10
Global average for worst cases for code size 5: 7.969

(Also, when you're done testing, change all the exports to ES6 syntax)
