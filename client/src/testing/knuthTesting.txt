Time taken to generate second guess (after 'rrbb' or 'rrrbb' etc):

4-code: 833.911, 834.268, 844.24, 850.304, 845.389, 834.418, 834.279, 832.738, 840.261, 850.447
Average: 840.0255 milliseconds
- So, under one second

6^4 = 1,296 permutations



5-code Average (ran this once): 17:58.794 (m:ss.mmm)
- About 18 minutes

8^5 = 32,768 permutations

6-code...
It takes approximately 2 seconds to check each permutation
- It's actually a tiny bit longer than 2 seconds

How many permutations are there?
- 10 possible colors, 6 possible positions

10^6 = 1,000,000

1 million permutations

So, how long is 2 million seconds (2 seconds to calculate each permutation)?
- About 23 days.
