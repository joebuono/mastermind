ColorTracker State:
- colorTracker

ColorTracker Components:
- GlobalKnowledge (e.g., ? ? ? RED)
- Headers
- RowsContainer
  - Row
    - Color (circle)
    - Number (formatting examples: 0-5, 1-3, 0,1, 2)
    - Position * (see note below)

* Basically a miniature guess, but the circles are one of three types:
- Gray question mark (?) representing a possible position
- Red X (x) representing an impossible position
- Green check mark representing a certain position ***
- *** NOTE: We will need to adjust the algorithm to explicitly keep track of certain positions
  - For instance, there may be 2 blues, and we may know the position of one of the blues for certain, 
  yet still be uncertain as to where the other blue goes. 

ColorTracker Features:
- Highlight rows when we have "complete information" (i.e., when, for a given color, number.length === 1 and position.length === number[0])
- Updates GlobalKnowledge when green check marks appear in the table
- React tool tips pop up on hover with more detailed information about what the ColorTracker is displaying

HintButton
- Suggests what you next move should be
